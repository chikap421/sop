# sop
My SOP for application to *MS CS at Ontario Tech*, hoping to work under **Prof. Annie Lee** on expanding LLMs to accomodate additonal languages.

The SOP delves into my past experiences on:
- Exploring and benchmarking finetuning techniques for SOTA LLMs like GPT2
- Advanced knowledge of Python with deep learning frameworks like Pytorch, tensorflow, and keras.
- Reproducing experiments and code from published papers with code, github, and data repository
